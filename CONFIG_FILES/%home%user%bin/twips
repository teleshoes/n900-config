# Twip Server (TWitter IP utility - server)
# Interfaces with twip main script
# Performs logging, automatic retries, and verification of tweeted IP
# Intended to be used on the server as an automated task (e.g. cronjob)
#
# Twip is for sending and retrieving IP addresses to/from twitter.
# Intended to serve as a makeshift replacement for dynamic DNS
#
# Encrypts IPs weakly using OpenPGP `gpg'
# Sends data using the Twitter API through Net::Twitter
