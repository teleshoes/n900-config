3) take out the battery, put it back in, wait a sec.

this is the way the say to do it, but see below for a way that seems better:
hold u key on the keyboard
hook the phone up via usb while holding
if bright Nokia screen with usb symbol appears, let go of U key
otherwise, let go, wait 10s, unplug usb, hold u key and replug usb
repeat the above step until it works. if it really really isnt working,
charge the phone more and retry.

this may work better:
plug phone in via usb
turn phone on, being prepared to press U as soon as you see the
white Nokia screen
press and hold u on the keyboard
the nokia screen should be replaced with a Nokia screen with a usb symbol

4) reflash
run reflash.pl
this is more or less equivalent to:
#cd utils #or wherever you dled to
#sudo dpkg -i maemo_flasher-*_i386.deb --force-architecture #64-bit is fine
#sudo flasher-3.5 -F RX-51_*_PR_COMBINED_002_ARM.bin -f
#sudo flasher-3.5 -F RX-51_*.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin -R

the Nokia screen will flash white, then the phone will turn off

turn the phone on
this will be somewhat slower than a normal boot,
with most of the time spent on the five bouncing white dots

when you get to the normal initial boot menu,
(Language, Region, Time, Date) push save to dismiss it

et voila. maybe.
